# Smart Contract + Python Interaction

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Solidity smart contract to Ethereum (Sepolia)
and interact with it programmatically using Python.

The goal is to show end-to-end smart contract control from a backend system.

## Execution Notes

This project was developed and tested using:
- Google Colab (Python execution)
- Sepolia testnet
- Infura RPC

Code is structured for clarity and portfolio demonstration.
